# About this Application

## Organization of components

I have 3 main classes: App, FilteredList, and DisplayList. App simply contains the initial product list that will be used by the other classes and displays the entire site. FilteredList takes care of most of the state and button logic as well as display organization, such as the sidebar. DisplayList takes care of displaying the entire product list by mapping each product to an item card that displays relevant information. 

## How data is passed down through components

App.js returns a div containing FilteredList, which takes in the product list that is initialized in App. Then, FilteredList's render function's return method includes a div that contains DisplayList, with the filtered product list passed in, as the filtering and sorting is done throughout the class. Then, DisplayList is then able to take that filtered list and display it accordingly.

## How the user trigger state changes

The user can trigger state changes by clicking on the radio buttons on the sidebar corresponding with Flavor filters, Type filters, and Sorting by Price. Each of these radio buttons trigger a function that is defined in FilteredList that will update the state and change the display of the product list accorrdingly. For example, clicking on the radio button labeled "Strawberry" under the "Flavor" section will trigger the onSelectFilterFlavor function and update the flavor in the state of FilteredList. Also, the user can trigger state changes in the cart as well by either clicking on the "Add 1 to cart" button under any product card, or the "Remove 1 from cart" button under each item in the cart. This will update the cart portion of the state and update the display accordingly. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
